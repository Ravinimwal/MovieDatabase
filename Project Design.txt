Design Thinking Process-
  1) I have used Object Oriented Programming Approach instead of conventional functional programming to manage the code more efficiently and increase readablity of the code.
  2) I have MYSQL instead of SQLite because MySQL is suitable for large-scale applications and websites that require a robust, high-performance, and scalable relational database. It can handle concurrent 
     connections, complex queries, and extensive data sets. MySQL is often used for enterprise-level applications and projects while SQLite is best suited for lightweight applications, mobile apps, 
     embedded systems, and small to medium-sized projects. It's not designed for high-concurrency scenarios or very large datasets and the Requirements given in the problem statement clearly mentioned that
     number of requests may increase to 15million per day. Thus MySQL.
  3) I have flask for implementing API's instead of some other framework-
      I) Flask is highly flexible and allows developers to choose and integrate their preferred libraries and components for various tasks.
      II) Flask's minimalistic design results in less boilerplate code compared to some larger frameworks. This can lead to faster development times and cleaner, more readable code.
      III) Flask is widely adopted in both small and large projects, making it a solid choice for building web applications across a range of scales.
  4) For Maintaining the privacy of Users, I have implemented hashing to store the hashed password of user in the Database instead directly saving the password. This increases confidence of the clients that 
     user information will be safe and may prevent the informartion of users in case of potentital hacking attempts.
